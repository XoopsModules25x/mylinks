   that asks you if you want to import the default categories.

   installation it may be in a different folder).
     NOTE: Renaming is not supported for an module upgrade.  You must
           leave the module directory unchanged.  You may not change the
           module directory name once it has been installed!  If you want
           to put the module into a different directory you must make a
           data backup of your module data (using phpMyAdmin or equiv),
           deactivate and then uninstall the old version of mylinks
           completely.  It is recommended that you delete the old mylinks
